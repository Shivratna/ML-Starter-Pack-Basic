# Basic ML-Training for Starters
Basic character probability based ML use for text generation and training for starters in Machine Learning.

USED:
-JSON
-NUMPY
-REQUESTS(is required)
-Markov chain model based

#Training:
This code takes the text data and stores it as a dictionary with character (window defined) and uses MARKOV Chain model to generate probablity based results.
Uses JSON to save the dict. data to text file

#Implementation.py
This code uses the stored data (trained data set in mind) to generate outputs that are totally random.

#Mind.txt
This text file contains the trained data set
